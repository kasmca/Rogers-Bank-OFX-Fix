# Rogers-Bank-OFX-Fix
2025 09 Rogers bank redid their website and broke OFX importing into MS Money.  This is a fix.

After Rogers Bank updated their website, OFX files are no longer valid imports for Microsoft Money.  This program converts the downloadable ofx files into a version compatible with Microsoft Money.

Additionally, Rogers Bank limited downloads to just complete monthly statements with no ability to select date ranges or "since last downloaded".  I added a feature to select all, select none or select specific sets of transactions.  Use a combination of Shift, CTRL and select to only convert and import the transactions you want.

Finally, even prior to this update, previous downloaded transaction dates were incorrectly set to 1 day earlier.  This program will correct that.

I have logged a ticket with Rogers Bank at 1-855-775-2265 to ask them address this issue.  I encourage you to do the same.
